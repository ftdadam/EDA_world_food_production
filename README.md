# EDA_world_food_production
EDA world food and feed production from 1961 to 2013


This project is intented to run in a jupyter notebook. I was able to use ipympl and ipywidgets to make interactive plots within jupyter.

You can hover the plots and use dropdowns to change Countries, Types of Food and make different groupings.

Everytime you do, a new figure is generated: A low value of max concurrent figures may cause issues.
